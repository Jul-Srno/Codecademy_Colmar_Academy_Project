# Colmar Academy - Final Project (Codecademy Skill Path)

**Author:** Jul_Srno  
**Project Type:** Training / Exercise project  
**Description:** Desktop & Mobile responsive layout  

---

## Overview

This project is the final exercise from Codecademy's HTML/CSS skill path. The goal was to reproduce a given specification as closely as possible, focusing on **accessibility** and **flexbox layout**. 

Because this is a guided exercise, the design is somewhat **unrealistic**: I ended up using **many `id`s, margins, and padding** to align elements almost like a table. In a real-world project, I would have applied more **creative freedom**, cleaner layouts, and reusable components.  

The purpose here was to practice **specific course concepts**, including:

- Proper semantic HTML (`section`, `article`, `header`, `footer`)  
- Accessibility features (`aria-labelledby`, `aria-hidden`, `title` attributes for videos)  
- Responsive design using **flexbox** and media queries  
- Desktop and Mobile layout management

> **Note:** I had not originally planned to put this project on GitHub. There is **no version history**—everything is in a single commit reflecting the final state of the exercise.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — main HTML file with desktop and mobile sections  
- `style.css` — styling including desktop and responsive mobile layouts  
- `resources/` — images and video assets  

---

## Notes

- **Accessibility:** All interactive or meaningful elements have accessible labels. Images used purely for decoration have `aria-hidden="true"`.  
- **Responsiveness:** Mobile-specific sections use separate HTML elements and flexbox adjustments for a better experience on smaller screens.  
- **Training purpose:** This project was built strictly to follow the exercise instructions. Its layout choices are intentional for practice, even if they are not realistic for production environments.

## Feedback

As a beginner and amateur developer, **any comments, corrections, or suggestions** are very welcome. They will help me **understand, learn, and improve** my HTML/CSS and accessibility practices.
